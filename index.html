I am currently a master of Engineering student at Cornell <a href="https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie"> Operations Research and Information Engineering</a>.
I completed my BS degree in Mathematics at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/"> University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a>. 
In my third year of undergraduate study, I was lucky to join the research group advised by <a href="https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/fenglm"> Liming Feng</a>.

I have laid a comprehensive foundation for myself when it comes to dealing with challenges in financial engineering. 
I aspire to apply my expertise and insights to promote the application of financial engineering tools in Chinaâ€™s market and fill the gap in the development of Fintech. 
Also, I really enjoy developing innovative solutions to challenging problems like derivatives trading using optimization models as well as cutting-edge machine learning.
