The focus of this research article is on the Markowitz portfolio selection model which is
designed to avoid the idiosyncratic risk through asset diversification. The Mean Variance portfolio
optimization, the Value-at-Risk (VaR), and the Mean-Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) are the three
classical treatments for the Markowitz portfolio selection problem. There are disadvantages in using
the mean variance framework, e.g., the variance is sensitive to outlier data, it can fail to capture the tail
risk, and it is relatively difficult for investment advisors to explain its relevance with risk to customers
and stake holders. Hence, the VaR and CVaR frameworks gained popularity, where they consider the
tail distribution of the portfolio returns. The VaR metric is not sub-additive, it is non-convex and non smooth, and it can have multiple local minima. 
On the other hand, the CVaR framework corresponds
with a convex optimization, which can be solved by linear programming models. Hence, the CVaR
framework is preferable over the other VaR and mean variance methods. The CVaR framework can
be unreliable due to estimation errors which can be magnified by the optimization problems used
for portfolio selection. In order to alleviate the sensitivity of the CVaR framework to estimation
errors, Salahi et al. presented a CVaR Robust Mean-CVaR portfolio optimization framework which
is studied extensively in this article. Robust optimization techniques are utilized to address estimation
errors in risk and return. Additionally, in order to reduce the computational complexity of the CVaR
Robust Mean-CVaR framework, the smoothing technique proposed by Alexander et al. is taken
advantage of in this work. An extensive study on the theoretical details of the above-mentioned
portfolio selection methods is complemented by extensive numerical results in this article.
